# Project Movies
This is a project that was made during the Technigo Bootcamp. The assignment was to build a **multi-page React application**, with a given design. We fetched the movie data from an external API.

## The problem
We started out by analyzing the given design and thereafter deciding on which components, pages and functionality we would need. The we started to construct these and linking them together using **React Router**. The startpage is a movie gallery and by clicking on one of the movies you come to a movie detail page. We also implemented a "Go back" link so that the user could go back to the list. 

If we had more time we would work more with handling errors, and displaying different error messages or pages. We explored this a bit but we did not have enough time to get it fully functional. 

We also had a little bit of problem to make the animation on 'BackButton' to have a smooth transition back to its original position. Otherwise we are satisfied with the end result in respect to the design.
